# Breast_Cancer_Detection_using_Decsion_Tree_Classifier

**Breast cancer** is cancer that develops from breast tissue.Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin.

**Risk factors** for developing breast cancer include being female, obesity, lack of physical exercise, drinking alcohol, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, early age at first menstruation, having children late or not at all, older age, prior history of breast cancer, and family history.



## Our Model

We prepare a **DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER** on the [Breast Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) to determine whether patients tumour is [malignant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignancy) or [benign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_tumor)



## About Dataset

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. n the 3-dimensional space is that described in: **K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: *"Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets"*, Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34.**


**Attribute Information**:

1) ID number 2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 

3-32) Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) **radius** (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) b) **texture** (standard deviation of gray-scale values) c) **perimeter** d) **area** e) **smoothness** (local variation in radius lengths) f) **compactness** (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) g) **concavity** (severity of concave portions of the contour) h) **concave points** (number of concave portions of the contour) i) **symmetry** j) **fractal dimension** ("coastline approximation" - 1)

## Class distribution: 

  357 benign, 212 malignant
